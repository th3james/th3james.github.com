So, posterous is dead, so I've been forced to move this blog to a new home. Perhaps foolishly, I'm trusting another free provider (this time, github) to host my blog. I am at least running Octopress this time, so migration should be easier.

Anyway, apologies for being a bit quiet on here recently, but I've been busy with lots of exciting stuff to do with Backbone.js which I'll be releasing over the next few months.
